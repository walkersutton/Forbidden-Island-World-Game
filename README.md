Completed June 2018
Final project for CS2510 // Fundamentals of Computer Science II

*sidenote
I never managed to complete the entire functionality of the game - the player never 'dies' when he touches the water, hence the creative user guide.

Forbidden Island Game

Objective of the game is to control Megaman around the world, and collect all  of the parts to the helicopter.

Megaman is very strong and chooses to carry all of the helicopter parts on his back.

Once you collect all of the parts to the helicopter, you will find that when you arrive to the helicopter nothing happens. You later discover that although Megaman is all mighty and powerful, he is not capable of repairing a very complicated helicopter. Since Megaman is precautious and thinks ahead, he already put on his scuba suit before he took off in his rather dinky helicopter. Megaman can blissfully swim through the world without any mishaps. Megaman's scuba suit holds the ability to teleport to new and unexplored terrains by pressing the m, r, or t keys. If Megaman gets tired of swimming and teleporting, you can give Megaman a break by pressing the escape key.

Controls:

- You can move Megaman up, down, left, and right using the arrow keys.
- You can start a new game with a perfect mountain by pressing m
- You can start a new game with a random mountain by pressing r
- You can start a new game with a random terrain by pressing t
